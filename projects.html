              This is the current site you are on. It was entirely coded by me without using a web builder. This is a continuing project that will be updated as I learn more and have new projects to add. I plan on adding some more complex interactions/designs that I know how to do, but I am holding off on doing so until I can integrate them smoothly without looking out of place.

              This is a site that I created and maintain for a company I am a board member of. It is created using GoDaddy's Website builder.

            <p>
              This is an HTML form I created so people can see how much per month "X" dynaCERT units will cost if they are being financed. It is on the Afaayo website in the earlier section. It can be hard to find unless you are looking for it so I added it here. The code in action can be seen right below this.

            <h3>Venn Diagram Algorithm <a class="clear" href="files/Venn_Programs.zip"><i class="fa fa-download"></i></a></h3>
            <p>
              This is the C++ code that I used for the paper here. The Basics of what it does is it takes in a file of Venn diagrams and finds what it called the dual graph of the diagram which is then passed into my algorithm. My algorithm tries to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph and returns if it was successful. The code comes in a zip file that has all the code, a ReadMe file with running instructions, and a Bash file for the actual running of the program.

            <h3>Ray Tracer <a class="clear" href="files/Ray_Tracer.zip"><i class="fa fa-download"></i></a></h3>
            <p>
              This is a basic ray tracer I created in my computer graphics course. It implements ambient, diffuse, and specular light as well as shadows. The main objects it has are spheres and planes but more object can be added easily.
            </p>

            <h3>Interactive World <a class="clear" href="files/Interactive_World.zip"><i class="fa fa-download"></i></a></h3>
            <p>
              This program creates a procedurally generated world with a user controlled camera. It implements a dynamic light model, basic animation, spheres, cubes, triangle meshes, controllable camera, and more. To run it, you will need to use QT Creator or Visual Studio 2013 and higher.
            </p>

            <h3>More Comming Soon</h3>
            <p>
              There is plenty more to add but they need some cleaning up and modifications before being added.

            <h3>A Fast Way to Extend Simple Venn Diagrams <a class="clear" href="files/Venn_Report.pdf"><i class="fa fa-download"></i></a></h3>
            <p>
              This is a paper that I wrote entirely in LaTeX for a final project in a topics course in algorithms. It covers a conjecture proposed by Peter Winkler and presents an algorithm that finds if a simple Venn diagram is extendable or not. The result was an algorithm that could extend the 3,430,404 6-Venn diagrams 90% of the time in one hour. The algorithm developed by the professor did an exhaustive search that took three days. Using my algorithm to eliminate 90% of the diagrams and then run the professors algorithm would reduce the total computation time drastically to do an exhaustive search. The code can be found in the code section under Venn Diagram Algorithm.

            <h3>Mathematics of Air Combat <a class="clear" href="files/Mathematics%20of%20Air%20Combat.pdf"><i class="fa fa-download"></i></a></h3>
            <p>
              This is a paper that I wrote for my history of world war II course. It covers a couple of areas where mathematicians made contributions to improve air to air combat. My professor liked it so much that it was the only paper to get an A+ which is rare from him, and he suggested I submit it to an undergraduate journal. I did that and it is now in the per-review stage.
